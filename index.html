						I am an enthusiastic, hardworking individual driven by passion and curiosity. I enjoy critical thinking and problem solving
						with unparalleled persistence and dedication. My professional and academic experiences have allowed me to develop strong interpersonal skills 
						and a rigorous work ethic. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I recently graduated the University of Calgary with a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering and a minor in Mechatronics. During those
						four years, I gained valuable experience working on projects independantly and cooperatively both in-person and online. I am actively searching
						for a role in robotics, fintech, security, and defense to advance my career as an Engineer in Training.

							<h1 class = "text-center">More About Me</h1>
							<br>
							<p>
								I was born in Calgary Alberta and have lived here all my life. My close proximity to the Rocky Mountains has made me an avid hiker, 
								snowboarder and mountain biker. Beyond my calculated and collected persona, I am a thrill seeker to the core. I have gone skydiving, hiked 
								nearly every attainable peak in the Kanaskis and Canmore area, and regularly snowboard the notorious Taynton Bowl in Panorama. <br><br>
								I come from a relatively large family with 5 siblings. Education and music were at the forefronts of our upbringing, allowing me to complete 
								my advanced RCM exam in violin and develop a keen interest in music production. As a result, I spend a large portion of my free time 
								listening to music and electronically creating my own. I also enjoy playing chess, and reading theology and philosophy.

							<p>
								In 2022, I took on the role of president of the Hack Your Learning club at the University of Calgary. I spent the school year recruiting 
								new club members and coordinating events to benefit students in Software Engineering and Computer Science. Specfically, I led the club with
								organizing the Schulich Engineering competition (SEC), the first ever national SchulichHacks Hackathon (see left), a number of educational 
								seminars presented by Calgary-based tech companies, and social events to promote competitions and provide networking opportunities for students.
								<br>
								Beyond the relevant professional experiences I listed above, I have had the opportunity to gain experience in a number of unique work environments 
								including lifeguarding, swim instructing, caretaking, customer service and landscaping. I am currently working part-time as a private Math tutor, 
								teaching highschool mathematics and calculus.
